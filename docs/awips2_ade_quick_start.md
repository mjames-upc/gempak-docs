# AWIPS2 ADE Quick Start


So I have to install awips2-cave and then the ADE in order to run/deploy/debug CAVE in eclipse, *as* an eclipse plugin?

Why is Qpid required for ADE install?  Why Qpid client and server?

## Download the ADE and Source Code

	/awips2/repo/awips2-ade-13.2.1-19/

and the source code will be in
	
	/awips2/repo/awips2-ade-13.2.1-19/awips2/


This directory will be your 

## ade_quick_install.sh

1) requires boost-devel installed
	
	yum install boost-devel -y
