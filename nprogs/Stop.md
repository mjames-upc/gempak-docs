				STOP

The stop function terminates data loading while in progress.  Click the
"Stop" icon located on the top right hand side of the main NMAP GUI to 
terminate loading.  Clicking "Stop" will end data loading after all data 
are loaded into the current frame.  The number of frames in the 
"Data Select" time line is modified to reflect the number of frames loaded 
in each loop.  Note that the stop function is disabled while frames are being
loaded after adjusting the size of the NMAP data display window.
